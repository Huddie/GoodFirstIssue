-> go out and fetch all isues of interest 
-> sort these issues into their repositories 
-> in the repositories, sort the issues into lists 








 

is there a reliable way to search for frameworks the same way you do for languages? 
search for orgs too - all the 'good first issues' in google, for example 

Return a list of repositories with a count of the number of issues w/ certain labels, and be able to sort by them 
notifications when new 'good-first issues' popup
be able to make a list of repo's and save them/ bookmark them and add notes 

important variables: last pull request, stars 
an option to search for 'big company' repos.. ie facebook, linkedin, apple, etc ... or bonified orgs instead of isolated projects 

current plan is to make multiple requests to filter what we need - how to do multiple async requests in javascript 

# look into caching 

you could start an email list or notification scheme with new first-time issues, help wanted, etc 

Github Newsletter sort of thing 

get ppl to write articles for you
