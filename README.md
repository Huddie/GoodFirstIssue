# GoodFirstIssue


GoodFirstIssue is a website designed to help new open source contributors find projects that are inviting to new contributors, by looking for projects with lots of issues marked with labels welcoming contributions. 

## Current Status

Currently I've set up a prototype at [www.goodfirstissue.com](http://goodfirstissue.com/).
