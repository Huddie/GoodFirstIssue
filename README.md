# GoodFirstIssue


## Our Goal
The open source community it truly one of the most amazing online communities one can be apart of. If you've been apart of the community for awhile you know what we're talking about. On the other hand, if you're new to the open source community, it may seem daunting. After all, one of the most amazing parts is that beginners and experts and all skill levels in between work together on the same project. As a beginner you may not feel comfortable solving an issue or displaying your code for people to critique. For that reason, having a strong, **welcoming** community is essential. The first open source project and with it the first open source community you join can make a lasting impact on whether you stick with open source in the future, maybe even your perception of collaborative programming in general. Our goal for GoodFirstIssue is to help direct newcomers to warm, welcoming open source communities.

## The GoodFirstIssue Project
If you read the Our Goal section above you know what we're all about. To achieve this we want to help in three ways.

1. This project itself is and **will always be** a warm, welcoming community. We will do our best to label issues appropriately and help if/whenever someone needs help. In a truly amazing way, newcomers, through this project, can help other newcomers while they ease their way into the open source community. So please contribute, we'd love to have you in our community. Check out the CONTRIBUTING.md file for a detailed explanation on how to get going.
2. This project is setup to help find _other_ repositories/projects that have a warm, welcoming community. In that sense, we hope that the use of [our website](www.goodfirstissue.com) will help newcomers find these amazing communities.
3. We ourselves are here to help guide and answer questions if you have any. If you have a question about the open source community we will try our bests to answer it. If we can't (Hey we're new to this also!) we will reach out to more experienced developers and try to get the answer for you. 


## Contributing 

Being that we want the barrier to entry into this project as low as possible we have a request.

If you ever get stuck, if you're ever confused with wording, make a pull request that either fixes this ambiguity or add the issue and the way you got around it to the FAQ.md file. This way as contributors join, our barrior to entry drops!

Alright, now that we got our request out of the way, head over to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for step-by-step instructions for setup and making contributions.
