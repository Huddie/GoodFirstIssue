# GoodFirstIssue


GoodFirstIssue is a website designed to help new open source contributors find great projects to work on, by searching for projects with issues and labels welcoming new contributions. 

## Current Status

Currently I've set up a prototype at [www.goodfirstissue.com](http://goodfirstissue.com/).
